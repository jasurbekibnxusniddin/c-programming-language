C Programming Language

## five basic data types
* there are five atomic data types in the C subset
	1. character				**char**
	2. integer					**int**
	3. floating-point			**float**
	4. double floating-point	**double**
	5. valueless				**void**

* The list of modifiers is shown here:
	* signed
	* unsigned
	* long
	* short


  **type**    	  **Typical size bits**   **minimal range**
	char 					8 				0−127 to 127
	unsigned char 			8 				0 to 255
	signed char 			8 				−127 to 127
	int 					16 or 32 		−32,767 to 32,767
	unsigned int 			16 or 32 		0 to 65,535
	signed int 				16 or 32 		same as int
	short int 				16 				−32,767 to 32,767
	unsigned short int 		16 				0 to 65,535
	signed short int 		16 				same as short int
	long int 				32 				−2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
	signed long int 		32 				same as long int
	unsigned long int 		32 				0 to 4,294,967,295
	float 					32 				Six digits of precision
	double 					64 				Ten digits of precision
	long double 			80				Ten digits of precision
